    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Basque cheesecake was created in 1990 by Santiago Rivera of the La Viña restaurant in the Basque Country, Spain. It is composed of burnt custard and no crust. It achieved popularity online in the 2010s, helped by a recipe published by the British food writer Nigella Lawson.</p>
